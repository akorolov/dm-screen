# Initiative Tracker

This is the source code for an initiative tracker I build. 

Access the tracker at dm.akorl.xyz

## Instructions

The left text box is for initiative. Use the button at the bottom to re-order the characters based on their initiative. Add characters using the Add Character button. 

For health/damage tracking, you can type 25+5 and then hit enter or 25-5 and then hit enter to do calculations (like a calculator). Use this to keep track of health during combat. You can add conditions underneath with free text, whatever you want to call it. 

Remove a character from the list by clicking the skull icon. 

Characters (and initiative) are saved to local storage and will be saved through page reloads. Health and conditions are not saved.
